# Intent of this class is to act as a control / template for the most common use-case we have at Voxana, kinda like ETL:
# * Uploads voice
# * Transcribes
# * Picks workflow (e.g. networking_dump, hubspot_sync, just voice-note)
# * * (Optional) Does pre-processing, e.g. split the transcript into multiple chunks / items.
