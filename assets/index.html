                Then I also talked to Miguel Coelho who did a work on MBA and he's he worked at Salesforce and SAP before.

                Give me a second, with a woman who just became a mentor. Her name is Daria Derkach and she's engineering manager at Atlassian. She's mentor at First Round and Berkeley Skydeck.<br />What I would like to know more about her is basically what is sort of her sector focus and also what she could basically give a second opinion on when we ever need that. Also when it comes to Atlassian, obviously it's sort of like a productivity tool, right? And like future of work tool. So I would definitely sort of have her sort of in my mind when there is anything when it comes to productivity tools and future of work.
