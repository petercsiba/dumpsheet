Dumpsheet is a resurrection of our attempt at Voxana.ai

It is a micro tool with a sole purpose of dumping your brain into a sheet
or dumpsheet.

User Journey:
* Create a Google Sheet
* * Either from a template e.g. networking spreadsheet, Salesforce Data Entry
* * Or your own 
* Share with sheets@voxana.iam.gserviceaccount.com (Google UI at its best)
* Voxana uses first N rows to derive the form
* You get an email with a magic link for recording input
* * And an email address to send recordings to
* Record voice input through web frontend
* Displays current fields
* Voxana transcribes, structures and updates the spreadsheet 
* Send an email summary
