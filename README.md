Dumpsheet is a resurrection of our attempt at Voxana.ai

It is a micro tool with a sole purpose of dumping your brain into a sheet, thus dumpsheet.com. 
Simply record your thoughts either through the webapp or your favorite voice recorder, 
and dumpsheet.com will structure it for you based on your spreadsheet columns. 

Can be used for:
* Bulk Voice Data Entry
* CRM imports
* Voice Forms filled just by talking
* Creating a TODO list while taking a walk

User Journey:
* Create a Google Sheet
* * Either from a template e.g. networking spreadsheet, Salesforce Data Entry
* * Or your own 
* Share with sheets@voxana.iam.gserviceaccount.com (Google UI at its best)
* You get an email with a magic link for recording input
* * And an email address to send recordings to
* Record voice input through web frontend
* Voxana transcribes, structures and updates the spreadsheet (automatically recognizing the intent) 
* Send an email summary
